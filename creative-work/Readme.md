# Little mental confabulations redacted to amuse

You will quickly notice here, every single page here is not related to code. These little stories have been crafted in my illogical, dim and somewhat creature section of my brain as I daydream though life.

I've written these stories as an attempt to flush my imagination into pages, allowing me to turn it into cohesive tales that could be read when there is a bit of leisure time.

### Days clouded by shadows

A long time ago, there was a planet inhabited by creatures descending of the stars... obviously, we are descendants of stars too, the components in our bodies were baked in a star who knows when and eventually made this planet, but theirs was different, children rained on the planet like persistent little meteorites waking up on a watery world.

Their souls burn hot with the flame of their curiosity, quite literally!

This story takes you in their journey before darkness took their little world.
